## 🔄 **How the Payment Flow Works:**

### **1. Seller Setup (One-time)**
```
Seller → Dashboard → "Set Up Payment Processing" → Stripe Connect Onboarding
```
- Seller creates Stripe Connect account
- Provides bank account details to Stripe
- Account gets verified by Stripe
- Seller can now receive payments

### **2. When a Customer Buys a Costume**
```
Customer Payment → Stripe → Platform Commission (12%) → Seller (88%)
```

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Customer pays** $100 for a costume
2. **Stripe processes** the payment
3. **Platform takes** $12 commission (12%)
4. **Seller receives** $88 to their bank account (88%)
5. **Automatic transfer** via Stripe Connect

---

## 💳 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Payment Intent Creation:**
```typescript
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 10000, // $100.00 in cents
  currency: 'usd',
  application_fee_amount: 1200, // $12.00 platform commission
  transfer_data: {
    destination: sellerStripeAccountId, // Seller's Stripe account
  },
  // ... other options
});
```

### **Commission Calculation:**
```typescript
const platformFee = calculatePlatformFee(amount); // 12% of $100 = $12
const sellerAmount = calculateSellerAmount(amount); // $100 - $12 = $88
```
